Exercises I'm doing while revising PHP. For LEARNING purposes you can change and/or modify these files but DON'T EVER USE THEM IN REAL-WORLD AT ALL. If anything goes wrong it will be your own fault and not mine. I'm not giving any type of guarantee neither I'll be responsible for anything if something goes wrong.
